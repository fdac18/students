Information on forming teams
===================================

As you’ll see in the Team Policy Statement below, you
will have assigned roles in your teams (coordinator, recorder, checker, etc.) 
that rotate among the members. You may be inclined to ignore these role
assignments and just do the work in any way that
comes to mind, or maybe one team member will
actually do the coordinating all semester no matter who is supposed
to be doing it for a given
assignment. That’s a mistake. I strongly advise you
to take the roles seriously --— your work will go more
smoothly and turn out better if you do. Also, the
roles each involve different skills, all of which you’ll
need to function effectively as professionals. Now
is the time to start picking up those skills—and you
can’t do it if you never take on the roles.

Some teams like to divide and conquer, parceling
out different parts of the assignment, completing
them individually, and stapling the different parts
together and handing them in (perhaps after first
recopying them in a single handwriting to make it
look more like a unified effort). Don’t do it! On
tests and/or when you report on your work, you
will be examined individually on every aspect of
the assignment, and your grade will depend in part
on how well you understand both the part that you
mainly did and all the other parts. Before you hand
anything in, go over it in detail and make sure
you’re ready for that examination.

A common mistake is for teams to sit around a table
and solve all problems together. What usually happens is that someone on the team is faster than the
others, and that one will begin every problem solution. If you happen to be in the slower category,
you may have to figure out how to approach such
problems for the first time on the tests, which is
not when you want to do it. A better approach is
for every team member to outline the solutions individually, and then get together to work out the
details.


#Team Policies
Your team will have a number of responsibilities as it completes
problem and project assignments. 

* Designate a coordinator, recorder and checker for each
assignment. Add a monitor for 4-person teams.  Rotate these roles
for every assignment. Designate one member to be ready to present
the work in front of the class. 

* Agree on a common meeting time and what each member should have
done before the meeting (readings, taking the first cut at some or
all of the assigned work, etc.)  There will be at least two classes
per project reserved exclusively for this purpose, but don't expect
that to be sufficient time for your joint work. Therefore,

* Do the required individual preparation. That means editing and
pushing the code, charts, presentations, or text to the teams'
repository before the meeting.

* Coordinator checks with other team members before the meeting to
remind them of when and where they will meet and what they are
supposed to do.

* Meet and work. Coordinator keeps everyone on task and makes sure
everyone is involved, recorder prepares the final solution and
creates the pull request to submit it, monitor checks to makes sure
everyone understands both the solution and the strategy used to get
it, and checker double-checks it before it is handed in. Agree on
next the meeting time and roles for next assignment. For teams of
three, the same person should cover the monitor and checker roles.

* Review returned assignments, read any comments made in the pull
 request. Correct if corrections are needed.
 
* Consult with your instructor if a conflict arises that can’t be worked through by the team.

* Dealing with non-cooperative team members. If a team member refuses to cooperate on an assignment, his/
her name should not be included on the completed work. If the problem persists, the team should meet with
the instructor so that the problem can be resolved, if possible. If the problem still continues, the cooperating
team members may notify the uncooperative member in writing that he/she is in danger of being fired,
sending a copy of the memo to the instructor. If there is no subsequent improvement, they should notify the
individual in writing (copy to the instructor) that he/she is no longer with the team. The fired student should
meet with his/her instructor to discuss options. Similarly, students who are consistently doing all the work
for their team may issue a warning memo that they will quit unless they start getting cooperation, and a
second memo quitting the team if the cooperation is not forthcoming. Students who get fired or quit must
either find another team willing to add them as a member or get zeroes for the remaining assignments.
As you will find out, group work isn’t always easy—team members sometimes cannot prepare for or attend
group sessions because of other responsibilities, and conflicts often result from differing skill levels and work
ethics. When teams work and communicate well, however, the benefits more than compensate for the difficulties.
One way to improve the chances that a team will work well is to agree beforehand on what everyone on the team
expects from everyone else. Reaching this understanding is the goal of the assignment on the Team Expectations
Agreement handout.
